## Fake ID Generator | Create a fake ID for your fake trip!

## About

[Check out our working version!](https://relaxed-heisenberg-4577a7.netlify.app/)

These times, a taking a fake trip might be more realistic than taking an actual one. For this, we built the Fake ID Generator. Users can take a picture of their face and after a few seconds, the facial features are detected. Users can then edit their face: add gorgeous eyebrows, impressive eyes or sensual lips. After they have edited their picture, a passport is generated, which they can also edit and save on their computer - to prepare for that special trip.

## Project goals

This project was built as part of the Codaisseur Academy. As a team of three, we worked together to create this app in three and a half days. Within our given theme 'travel', we wanted to work on a challenging and fun project, where we would learn something entirely new: work with a face detection API.

Working as a team was a lot of fun and very productive. We would meet a couple of times per day to discuss the project and work with Git branches, pull requests and rebase.
